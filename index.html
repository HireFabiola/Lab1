<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/obituaries/ANGELOU/ANGELOU-superJumbo.jpg">
<p>Maya Angelou is my shero because her voice speaks to the strength, resilience, and dignity I try to embody in my own life. Her journey from hardship to global influence inspires me to rise above adversity with courage and grace. In her writing, I find the wisdom, honesty, and emotional depth that help me understand myself and the world more clearly. The way she transforms pain into power, and her commitment to truth, compassion, and self‑worth, reflect the principles I admire most and strive to live by.</p>
